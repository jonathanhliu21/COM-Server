        """A decorator custom IO thread rather than using the default one.

        It is recommended to read `pyserial`'s documentation before creating a custom IO thread.

        What the IO thread executes every 0.01 seconds will be referred to as a "cycle".

        Note that this method should be called **before** `connect()` is called, or
        else the thread will use the default cycle.

        To see the default cycle, see the documentation of `BaseConnection`.

        What the IO thread will do now is:

        1. Check if anything is using (reading from/writing to) the variables
        2. If not, copy the variables into a `SendQueue` and `ReceiveQueue` object.
        3. Call the `custom_io_thread` function (if none, calls the default cycle)
        4. Copy the results from the function back into the send queue and receive queue.
        5. Rest for 0.01 seconds to rest the CPU

        The cycle should be in a function that this decorator will be on top of.
        The function should accept three parameters:

        - `conn` (a `serial.Serial` object)
        - `rcv_queue` (a `ReceiveQueue` object; see more on how to use it in its documentation)
        - `send_queue` (a `SendQueue` object; see more on how to use it in its documentation)

        To enable autocompletion on your text editor, you can add type hinting:

        ```py
        from com_server import Connection, SendQueue, ReceiveQueue
        from serial import Serial

        conn = Connection(...)

        # some code

        @conn.custom_io_thread
        def custom_cycle(conn: Serial, rcv_queue: ReceiveQueue, send_queue: SendQueue):
            # code here

        conn.connect() # call this AFTER custom_io_thread()

        # more code
        ```

        The function below the decorator should not return anything.
