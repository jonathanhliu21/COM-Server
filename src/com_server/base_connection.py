class BaseConnection:
    """A base connection object with a serial or COM port.

    If you want to communicate via serial, it is recommended to
    either directly use `pyserial` directly or use the `Connection` class.

    How this works is that it creates a pyserial object given the parameters, which opens the connection. 
    The user can manually open and close the connection. It is closed by default when the initializer is called.
    It spawns a daemon thread that continuously looks for serial data and puts it in a buffer. 
    When the user wants to send something, it will pass the send data to a queue,
    and the thread will process the queue and will continuously send the contents in the queue
    until it is empty, or it has reached 0.5 seconds. This thread is referred as the "IO thread".

    IO thread order:

    1. Checks if there is any data to be received
    2. If there is, reads all the data and puts the `bytes` received into the receive queue
    3. Tries to send everything in the send queue; breaks when 0.5 seconds is reached (will continue if send queue is empty)
    4. Rest for 0.01 seconds to lessen processing power

    If any of the steps above raises an exception (`OSError` or `SerialException`), 
    then the program will assume that the serial port has disconnected.

    All data will be encoded and decoded using `utf-8`.

    If used in a `while(true)` loop, it is highly recommended to put a `time.sleep()` within the loop,
    so the main thread won't use up so many resources and slow down the IO thread.

    This class contains the four basic methods needed to talk with the serial port:
    - `connect()`: opens a connection with the serial port
    - `disconnect()`: closes the connection with the serial port
    - `send()`: sends data to the serial port
    - `read()`: reads data from the serial port

    It also contains the property `connected` to indicate if it is currently connected to the serial port.

    If the USB port is disconnected while the program is running, then it will automatically detect the exception
    thrown by `pyserial`, and then it will reset the IO variables and then label itself as disconnected. It will
    then stop the IO thread. If `exit_on_disconnect` is True, it will send a `SIGTERM` signal to the main thread 
    if the port was disconnected.

    **Warning**: Before making this object go out of scope, make sure to call `disconnect()` in order to avoid thread leaks. 
    If this does not happen, then the IO thread will still be running for an object that has already been deleted.

    **Warning**: There will be NO errors thrown if this object is declared twice with the same port, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

            Note that this does NOT mean that it will be able to send every `send_interval` seconds. It means that the `send()` method will

            - `queue_size` (int) (optional): The number of previous data that was received that the program should keep. Must be nonnegative. By default 256.
            - `exit_on_disconnect` (bool) (optional): If True, sends `SIGTERM` signal to the main thread if the serial port is disconnected. Does NOT work on Windows. By default False.

        Sending data too rapidly (e.g. making `send_interval` too small, varies from computer to computer) is not recommended,

        Additionally, parts of the send queue will be all sent together until it reaches 0.5 seconds,

        If `check_type` is True, then it will process each argument, then concatenate, encode, and send.
            - If the argument is `bytes` then decodes to `str`
            - If argument is `list` or `dict` then passes through `json.dumps`
            - If argument is `set` or `tuple` then converts to list and passes through `json.dumps`

        Otherwise, converts each argument directly to `str` and then concatenates, encodes, and sends.

        - `*args`: Everything that is to be sent, each as a separate parameter. Must have at least one parameter.
        - `check_type` (bool) (optional): If types in *args should be checked. By default True.
        - `ending` (str) (optional): The ending of the bytes object to be sent through the serial port. By default a carraige return + newline ("\\r\\n")
        - `concatenate` (str) (optional): What the strings in args should be concatenated by. By default a space `' '`

        Returns:
