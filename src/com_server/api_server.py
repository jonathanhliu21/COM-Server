class RestApiHandler:
    """A handler for creating endpoints with the `Connection` and `Connection`-based objects.

    This class provides the framework for adding custom endpoints for doing
    custom things with the serial connection and running the local server
    that will host the API. It uses a `flask_restful` object as its back end.

    Note that endpoints cannot have the names `/register` or `/recall`.
    Additionally, resource classes have to extend the custom `ConnectionResource` class
    from this library, not the `Resource` from `flask_restful`.

    `500 Internal Server Error`s will occur with endpoints dealing with the connection
    if the serial port is disconnected. The server will spawn another thread that will
    immediately try to reconnect the serial port if it is disconnected. However, note
    that the receive and send queues will **reset** when the serial port is disconnected.

    If another process accesses an endpoint while another is
    currently being used, then it will respond with
    `503 Service Unavailable`.

    - `/register` (GET): An endpoint to register an IP; other endpoints will result in `400` status code
    if they are accessed without accessing this first (unless `has_register_recall` is False);
    if an IP is already registered then this will result in `400`; IPs must call this first before
    accessing serial port (unless `has_register_recall` is False)
    - `/recall` (GET): After registered, can call `/recall` to "free" IP from server, allowing other IPs to
    call `/register` to use the serial port

        This decorator should go above a class that

        contain implementations of request methods such as
        `get()`, `post()`, etc. similar to the `Resource`
        class from `flask_restful`. To use the connection
        object, use the `self.conn` attribute of the class
        under the decorator.

        For more information, see the `flask_restful` [documentation](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io).

        Note that duplicate endpoints will result in an exception.
        If there are two classes of the same name, even in different
        endpoints, the program will append underscores to the name
        until there are no more repeats. For example, if one class is
        named "Hello" and another class is also named "Hello",
        then the second class name will be changed to "Hello_".
        This happens because `flask_restful` interprets duplicate class
        names as duplicate endpoints.

        If another process accesses an endpoint while another is
        currently being used, then it will respond with
        `503 Service Unavailable`.
