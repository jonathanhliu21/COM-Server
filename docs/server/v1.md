# API version 1

## Getting started

To get started, import `V1` from the builtin `api` module.

```py
from com_server import Connection, ConnectionRoutes, start_app
from com_server.api import V1
from flask import Flask
from flask_restful import Api

app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)

conn = Connection(<baud>, "<serport>") 
handler = ConnectionRoutes(conn)

# add your own routes and endpoints here

V1(handler)
start_app(app, api, handler)
```

`V1` has an option `prefix`, indicating the prefix of all the routes in the builtin API. The default is `v1`, meaning that all version 1 API endpoints are prefixed with /v1/ (e.g. localhost:8080/v1/send).

Note that if you put V1 right before `start_app` and you have a resource that has the same path as one of the resources in the builtins, then the builtin resource will override your provided resource.
