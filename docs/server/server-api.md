# COM-Server Built-in API

## Endpoints from RestApiHandler

These endpoints cannot be used in any case with the `RestApiHandler`, even if `has_register_recall` is False. If they are defined again by the user, it will raise `com_server.EndpointExistsException`.

These endpoints will not apply if `has_register_recall` is False, and the response will be a `404 Not Found`.

```txt
/register
```

Registers an IP to the server. Note that this is IP-based, not
process based, so if there are multiple process on the same computer
connecting to this, the server will not be able to detect it and may
lead to unexpected behavior.

Method: GET

Arguments:
    None

Responses:

- `200 OK`: `{"message": "OK"}` if successful
- `400 Bad Request`: 
    - `{"message": "Double registration"}` if this endpoint is reached by an IP while it is registered
    - `{"message": "Not registered; only one connection at a time"}` if this endpoint is reached while another IP is registered

```txt
/recall
```

Unregisters an IP from a server and allows other IPs to use it.

Method: GET

Arguments:
    None

Responses:

- `200 OK`: `{"message": "OK}` if successful
- `400 Bad Request`:
    - `{"message": "Nothing has been registered"}` if try to call without any IP registered
    - `{"message": "Not same user as one in session"}` if called with different IP as the one registered

## Endpoints from Builtins

If the `Builtins` class is used on a `RestApiHandler` object, then both the endpoints above and the endpoints below cannot be used. If they are defined again by the user, the program will raise a `EndpointExistsException`.

```txt
/send
```

Endpoint to send data to the serial port.
Calls `Connection.send()` with given arguments in request.

Method: POST

Arguments:

- "data" (str, list): The data to send; can be provided in multiple arguments, which will be concatenated with the `concatenate` variable.
- "ending" (str) (optional): A character or string that will be appended to `data` after being concatenated before sending to the serial port.
By default a carraige return + newline.
- "concatenate" (str) (optional): The character or string that elements of "data" should be concatenated by if its size is greater than 1;
won't affect "data" if the size of the list is equal to 1. By default a space.

Responses:

- `200 OK`: 
    - `{"message": "OK"}` if send through
- `502 Bad Gateway`: 
    - `{"message": "Failed to send"}` if something went wrong with sending (i.e. `Connection.send()` returned false)

```txt
/receive
```

Endpoint to get data that was recently received.
If POST, calls `Connection.receive_str(...)` with arguments given in request.
If GET, calls `Connection.receive_str(...)` with default arguments (except strip=True). This means
that it responds with the latest received string with everything included after 
being stripped of whitespaces and newlines.

Method: GET, POST

Arguments (POST only):

- "num_before" (int) (optional): How recent the receive object should be.
If 0, then returns most recent received object. If 1, then returns
the second most recent received object, etc. By default 0.
- "read_until" (str, null) (optional): Will return a string that terminates with
character in "read_until", excluding that character or string. For example,
if the bytes was `b'123456'` and "read_until" was 6, then it will return
`'12345'`. If ommitted, then returns the entire string. By default returns entire string.
- "strip" (bool) (optional): If true, then strips received and processed string of
whitespaces and newlines and responds with result. Otherwise, returns raw string. 
Note that using {"strip": False} may not work; it is better to omit it.
By default False.

Response:

- `200 OK`:
    - `{"message": "OK", "timestamp": ..., "data": "..."}` where "timestamp"
    is the Unix epoch time that the message was received and "data" is the
    data that was processed. If nothing was received, then "data" and "timestamp"
    would be None/null.

```txt
/receive_all
```

Returns the entire receive queue. Calls `Connection.get_all_rcv_str(...)`.
If POST then uses arguments in request.
If GET then uses default arguments (except strip=True), which means that
that it responds with the latest received string with everything included after 
being stripped of whitespaces and newlines.

Method: GET, POST

Arguments (POST only):

- "read_until" (str, null) (optional): Will return a string that terminates with
character in "read_until", excluding that character or string. For example,
if the bytes was `b'123456'` and "read_until" was 6, then it will return
`'12345'`. If ommitted, then returns the entire string. By default returns entire string.
- "strip" (bool) (optional): If true, then strips received and processed string of
whitespaces and newlines and responds with result. Otherwise, returns raw string. 
Note that using {"strip": False} may not work; it is better to omit it.
By default False.

Response:

- `200 OK`:
    - `{"message": "OK", "timestamps": [...], "data": [...]}`: where "timestamps" 
    contains the list of timestamps in the receive queue and "data" contains the 
    list of data in the receive queue. The indices for "timestamps" and "data" match.

```txt
/get
```

Waits for the first string from the serial port after request.
If no string after timeout (specified on server side), then responds with 502.
Calls `Connection.get(str, ...)`.
If POST then uses arguments in request. 
If GET then uses default arguments (except strip=True), which means that
that it responds with the latest received string with everything included after 
being stripped of whitespaces and newlines.

Method: GET, POST

Arguments (POST only):

- "read_until" (str, null) (optional): Will return a string that terminates with
character in "read_until", excluding that character or string. For example,

Note that using {"strip": False} may not work; it is better to omit it.
By default False.

Response:

- `200 OK`:
    - `{"message": "OK", "data": "..."}` where "data" is received data
- `502 Bad Gateway`: 
    - `{"message": "Nothing received"}` if nothing was received from the serial port
    within the timeout specified on the server side.

- "concatenate" (str) (optional): What the strings in args should be concatenated by
