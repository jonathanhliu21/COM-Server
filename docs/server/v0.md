# API version 0

**This will not receive support after versions >=0.2. Use the version 1 API instead.**

## Adding the built-in routes

To add the built-in routes into your program, you need to use the `com_server.api` module. This module provides the built-in routes for all supported versions of the API. For example, to use version 0 of the API, you can simply import the `V0` class from the `com_server.api` module and wrap it around the `RestApiHandler` object. When the server is launched, this will add all routes from version 0, prefixed with `/v0`.

```py
from com_server import Connection, RestApiHandler
from com_server.api import V0

conn = Connection(<baud>, "<port>")
handler = RestApiHandler(conn)
V0(handler) # adds built-in endpoints from version 0

handler.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

Note that adding built-in routes means that those routes cannot be added again later. If they are, it will raise `com_server.EndpointExistsException`.

## Endpoints from RestApiHandler

These endpoints cannot be used in any case with the `RestApiHandler`, even if `has_register_recall` is False. If they are defined again by the user, it will raise `com_server.EndpointExistsException`.

These endpoints will not apply if `has_register_recall` is False, and the response will be a `404 Not Found`.

If an endpoint is reached while another process is using another endpoint, then the endpoint will respond with `503 Service Unavailable`.

```txt
/register
```

Registers an IP to the server. Note that this is IP-based, not
process based, so if there are multiple process on the same computer
connecting to this, the server will not be able to detect it and may
lead to unexpected behavior.

Method: GET

Arguments:
    None

Response:

- `200 OK`: `{"message": "OK"}` if successful
- `400 Bad Request`: 
    - `{"message": "Double registration"}` if this endpoint is reached by an IP while it is registered
    - `{"message": "Not registered; only one connection at a time"}` if this endpoint is reached while another IP is registered
- `503 Service Unavailable`:
    - `{"message": "An endpoint is currently in use by another process."}` if this endpoint was reached while another endpoint is in use.

```txt
/recall
```

Unregisters an IP from a server and allows other IPs to use it.

Method: GET

Arguments:
    None

Response:

- `200 OK`: `{"message": "OK}` if successful
- `400 Bad Request`:
    - `{"message": "Nothing has been registered"}` if try to call without any IP registered
    - `{"message": "Not same user as one in session"}` if called with different IP as the one registered
- `503 Service Unavailable`:
    - `{"message": "An endpoint is currently in use by another process."}` if this endpoint was reached while another endpoint is in use.

## What happens if the serial device disconnects?

When the server is started, there will be a thread checking the connection state of the serial device every 0.01 seconds, and if it disconnects, the thread will attempt to reconnect the device.

Any request made to any endpoint the requires use of the serial port will have a response of `500 Internal Server Error` when the device is disconnected and will behave normally once reconnected.

Notes:

- When it reconnects, it calls the `reconnect()` method in the `Connection` object. It will try to reconnect to the ports given in `__init__()`, which means that if the port was changed somehow between disconnecting and reconnecting, it will not reconnect and will require restarting the server.
- Disconnect and reconnect events will be logged to `stdout` for both development and production servers. You can specify a file to log these events to in the `logfile` parameter when calling [`RestApiHandler.run()`](http://localhost:8000/guide/library-api/#restapihandlerrun_dev) or [`RestApiHandler.run_dev()`](http://localhost:8000/guide/library-api/#restapihandlerrun_prod). The time, logging level (INFO and WARNING), and disconnect and reconnect messages will be logged to the file.
- Disconnecting the serial device will **reset** the receive and send queues.

All endpoints below will be prefixed with `/v0`. For example, to access `/send` on `localhost:8080`, you would need to visit `localhost:8080/v0/send`.

## Version-specific arguments

Some version-specific arguments for version 0 can be passed when initializing the `V0` or `Builtins` class from `com_server.api`. These include:

- `verbose`: Prints the arguments each endpoint receives to stdout. Should not be used in production. By default False.

## Endpoints from Builtins

```txt
/send
```

Endpoint to send data to the serial port.
Calls `Connection.send()` with given arguments in request.

Method: POST

Arguments:

- "data" (str, list): The data to send; can be provided in multiple arguments, which will be concatenated with the `concatenate` variable.
- "ending" (str) (optional): A character or string that will be appended to `data` after being concatenated before sending to the serial port.
By default a carraige return + newline.
- "concatenate" (str) (optional): The character or string that elements of "data" should be concatenated by if its size is greater than 1;
won't affect "data" if the size of the list is equal to 1. By default a space.

Response:

- `200 OK`: 
    - `{"message": "OK"}` if send through
- `502 Bad Gateway`: 
    - `{"message": "Failed to send"}` if something went wrong with sending (i.e. `Connection.send()` returned false)
- `400 Bad Request`:
    - `{"message": "Not registered; only one connection at a time"}` if `has_register_recall` is True and the user has not registered by going to the /register endpoint
- `503 Service Unavailable`:
    - `{"message": "An endpoint is currently in use by another process."}` if this endpoint was reached while another endpoint is in use.

```txt
/receive
```

Endpoint to get data that was recently received.
If POST, calls `Connection.receive_str(...)` with arguments given in request.
If GET, calls `Connection.receive_str(...)` with default arguments (except strip=True). This means
that it responds with the latest received string with everything included after 
being stripped of whitespaces and newlines.

Method: GET, POST

Arguments (POST only):

If 0, then returns most recent received object. If 1, then returns
the second most recent received object, etc. By default 0.
- "read_until" (str, null) (optional): Will return a string that terminates with
character in "read_until", excluding that character or string. For example,
if the bytes was `b'123456'` and "read_until" was 6, then it will return
`'12345'`. If ommitted, then returns the entire string. By default returns entire string.
- "strip" (bool) (optional): If true, then strips received and processed string of
whitespaces and newlines and responds with result. Otherwise, returns raw string. 
Note that using {"strip": False} may not work; it is better to omit it.
By default False.

Response:

- `200 OK`:
    - `{"message": "OK", "timestamp": ..., "data": "..."}` where "timestamp" (float, null)
    is the Unix epoch time that the message was received and "data" (string, null) is the
    data that was processed. If nothing was received, then "data" and "timestamp"
    would be None/null.
- `400 Bad Request`:
    - `{"message": "Not registered; only one connection at a time"}` if `has_register_recall` is True and the user has not registered by going to the /register endpoint

## Escape characters

When including escape characters (newlines, carriage returns, etc.) in a post request to one of the endpoints, the request might not interpret the character. For example, in some cases, if you send `ending="\n"` to the `/send` endpoint (other endpoints have this issue too; we're just using `/send` as an example), the server may interpret it as `"\\n"` (a backslash followed by `n`), rather than an actual newline. Below contains a list of ways to solve this for different programs:

### Python requests library

The Python requests library works by default if you put a normal newline character `\n` (or any other escape character) in the string. 

### cURL

If you are using `zsh` or `bash`, then you can use the `$''` syntax to include escape characters. For example, sending data to `/send` with cURL can look like:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -d "data=hello" -d $'ending=\n' <url>
```

### JSON

Escape characters should work normally with JSON. 

### Adding more programs

If you want to add more programs to this list, feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/jonyboi396825/COM-Server/pulls). If something does not work or you see something wrong, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/jonyboi396825/COM-Server/issues) under the category "Documentation."
